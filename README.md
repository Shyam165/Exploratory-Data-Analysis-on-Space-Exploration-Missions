Space Exploration Mission Analysis


This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of space exploration missions, focusing on trends, success rates, and factors influencing mission outcomes. The project utilizes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover insights from the data.

Project Overview
The field of space exploration is experiencing exponential growth, with advancements occurring at a rapid pace. Data analysis plays a crucial role in informing future endeavors and maximizing success rates. This project addresses the need for a comprehensive analysis of space exploration missions, aiming to answer critical questions such as:

How have overall mission success rates evolved over time?
Are there specific companies or rocket types that boast a higher success rate?
Which launch locations are most frequently utilized for space missions?
Roadmap
